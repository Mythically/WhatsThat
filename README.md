# WhatsThat
A react-native project for the Mobile Application development unit assesment.

Using expo, metro bundler, eslint.

Back-end provided by university, to be consued by a mobile app front-end.

When creating a new chat the application creates a new chat if one doesn't exist where the title of the chat is Your first name + Their first name;
Ie if you change the name of that chat it will assume a chat doesn't exist it will create a new one.
I decided to do it this way because in WhatsApp you cannot have multiple chats with one person.
